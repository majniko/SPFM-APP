## ðŸš¨ Security Warning

**This application is for demonstration and educational purposes only.**

**DO NOT use real passwords or sensitive personal details when using this application.**

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
-   [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app installed on your iOS or Android device.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-frontend-repo-url>
    cd <your-frontend-repo-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure the API endpoint for local development:**

    For the app to communicate with the backend from your physical device, you need to use your computer's local network IP address.

   -   Open the `src/api/api-client.ts` file.
   -   Find your computer's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
   -   Change the `API_URL` constant to point to the backend service running on your machine:
       ```typescript
       // Before
       const API_URL = 'http://192.168.0.105:3000';

       // After (example)
       const API_URL = 'http://192.168.1.100:3000';
       ```
    *Note: The backend must be running and accessible from your mobile device's network.*

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    npx expo start
    ```
    This will start the Metro bundler. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone to launch the application.
